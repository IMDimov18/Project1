<center><h2>PROMOTING WATER STEWARDSHIP<h2></center>
<div class="text">
<b><p>To benefit both people and nature, WWF advocates for and supports organizations to become responsible water stewards. At the global level, we work on projects to establish an international water stewardship standard through the Alliance for Water Stewardship. We also support the use of water footprinting tools with the Water Footprint Network and promote other international initiatives with the United Nations’ CEO Water Mandate and the World Economic Forum. At the local level, WWF conducts projects that measure water use and river basin impacts and demonstrate solutions for reducing these impacts. WWF partners with businesses and industries to identify water risks and take advantage of opportunities to enhance water stewardship.</p></b>

<center><h2>PROTECTING WETLANDS</h2></center>
<b><p>The international treaty known as the Ramsar Convention was established to protect wetlands around the world. Forty years later, there are more than 2,000 wetlands designated as Wetlands of International Importance. This means that the country where the wetland is located has committed itself to protecting the site from development, pollution, and drainage. About 75% of the sites added to the list since 1999 were included as a result of work by WWF.</p></b>

<center><h2>ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE</h2></center>
<div class="text2">
<b><p>WWF works to address institutional challenges to managing water resources and protecting habitats before the worst impacts of climate change occur. This work includes promoting climate change adaptation in international conventions and supporting the preservation and restoration of wetlands. We help conduct assessments of river basins’ vulnerabilities to climate change and integrate climate change considerations into river basin management.</p></b>
