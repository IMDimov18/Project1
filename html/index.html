<center><h2>What are our water resources?</h2></center>
<p>The rivers, the lakes, the oceans, all of these are our water resources. Also, water resource can be the rain and the subterranean waters. We use these resources for hydration, for washing and for many other things.</p>

<center><h2>What are the problems with our water supply?</h2></center>
<p>The water on the Earth is boiling down. Many cities and villages are becoming thirsty and dirty. Because of that they can't grow any food so they will not survive much longer. The other problem is that the water is becoming more and more polluted. The factoryes are throwing their unuseful stuff into rivers, lakes, even the ocean. That means the same destiny awaits the people who are getting their water supplies from these rivers and lakes.</p>
