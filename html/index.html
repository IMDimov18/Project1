<center><h2>What are our water supplies?</h2></center>
<p>The rivers, the lakes, the oceans, all of these are our water supplies.<br> Also, water supply can be the rain and the subterranean waters.<br> We use these supplies for hydration, for washing and for many other things.</p>

<div class="text1">
<center><h2>What are the problems with our water supplies?</h2></center>
<p>Well, the thing is that our water supllies are polluted and they started being undrinkable and unuseful.<br>The factories are throwing their unuseful things in the water.<br>
 The people on the beach coast are leaving stuff on the beach and the water is bilking them.</p>

<h2>What is the solution?</h2>
<p>Reduce the water usement, the less water you use, the more people that need it will get. Stop wasting it. Is it that hard to stop the water when you are soaping yourselfs in the shower or when you are brushing your theet and you don't use the water? </p>
